<!--About description SEO practice-->
<!-- A meta description is a brief summary of a webpage's content that appears in search engine results below the page title. It provides users with a concise overview of what the page is about, helping them decide whether to click on the link. Meta descriptions are typically around 150-160 characters long and should include relevant keywords to improve search engine optimization (SEO). A well-crafted meta description can increase click-through rates and drive more organic traffic to a website.
