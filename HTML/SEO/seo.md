### What is SEO

 SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It is the practice of optimizing a website to improve its visibility and ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs). The goal of SEO is to increase organic (non-paid) traffic to a website by making it more attractive to search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.

## Importance
SEO is important because it helps businesses and website owners reach their target audience more effectively. Higher search engine rankings lead to increased visibility, which can result in more website visitors, potential customers, and ultimately, higher revenue. Additionally, SEO can enhance the user experience by making websites more navigable and relevant to users' search queries.
