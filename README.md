### Overview

This public repository is a place where I share the knowledge I acquire throughout my career—not only language elements and attributes, but also problem-solving methods and techniques that can help me and my team in every project.

If you’d like to contribute—whether it’s an element, an attribute, a method, a bug fix, or anything else that can help both of us grow as developers—feel free to open a pull request.


## How to Contribute

Create a branch for your feature or fix:

Open a Pull Request describing what you changed and why.

## Purpose

I created this repository to document my learning journey and provide a reference for myself and others.

## Structure

For now, the repository contains a single folder: HTML
As I continue learning, I will add more folders (e.g., CSS/, JavaScript/, Algorithms/) following the same pattern.

## Acknowledgements

This repository is built with the knowledge I’m gaining from the freeCodeCamp
 Full-Stack Development course.
A big thanks to their team and community for providing such a comprehensive, free learning resource
